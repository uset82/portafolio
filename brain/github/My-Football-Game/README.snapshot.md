## 🚀 How to Run the Game

### ▶️ Quick Start (Click to Play!)
**[🎮 Launch Game](http://localhost:8080)** ← Click here if the Python server is running!

### Option 1: Simple (Double-Click)
1. Open the folder containing the game files
2. Double-click on `index.html`
3. The game opens in your web browser!

### Option 2: Using VS Code Live Server
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

### Option 3: Using Python Server
1. Open a terminal in the game folder
2. Run: `python -m http.server 8080`
3. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser

### Option 4: Online Multiplayer Server (socket.io)
1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Run server locally: `node server.js` (defaults to port 3000)
3. Set `WS_URL` to your server, e.g. `ws://localhost:3000` for local or `wss://your-app.onrender.com` when deployed.
4. Open the Netlify site with the WS URL if you want to override per session: `https://poetic-faun-843df2.netlify.app/?ws=ws://localhost:3000&room=testroom`
5. First player to connect becomes P1 (blue host), second is P2 (red). Host simulates and syncs state; both send inputs.

### Online multiplayer server URL
- Set env var `WS_URL` to your WebSocket endpoint (e.g., `wss://your-app.onrender.com`).
- On Netlify: Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment → Environment variables → add `WS_URL`, then redeploy.
- You can also override per-session with a query param: `?ws=wss://your-app.onrender.com`.
- The page will show a status banner when `WS_URL` is missing or when connection succeeds/fails.

### 📱 QR Code Multiplayer (NEW!)
Play with friends on separate devices:

1. **Deploy the server** to Render (free):
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and create a new Web Service
   - Connect your GitHub repo `https://github.com/uset82/My-Football-Game`
   - Render will auto-detect `render.yaml` and deploy
   - Copy your server URL (e.g., `wss://football-game-server.onrender.com`)

2. **Configure Netlify**:
   - Go to your Netlify site settings → Environment variables
   - Add `WS_URL` = `wss://your-render-url.onrender.com`
   - Redeploy

3. **Play with a friend**:
   - Open the game → tap "🌐 ONLINE (with Friend)"
   - Tap "📱 CREATE ROOM" → QR code appears
   - Friend scans QR with their phone camera
   - Game starts automatically when both connected!
