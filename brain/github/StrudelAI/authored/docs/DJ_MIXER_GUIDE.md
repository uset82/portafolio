## Step-by-Step Tutorials

### ?? Tutorial 1: Basic Crossfade Mix

Learn to smoothly transition between two tracks.

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Press **Play** on Deck A | Deck A starts playing |
| 2 | Move crossfader to the LEFT (-1) | Only Deck A is audible |
| 3 | Press **Play** on Deck B | Deck B starts (but muted by crossfader) |
| 4 | Slowly move crossfader to CENTER (0) | Both decks blend 50/50 |
| 5 | Continue moving crossfader to RIGHT (+1) | Deck B takes over completely |

**Pro Tip:** Use slow movements for smooth transitions!

---

### ?? Tutorial 2: Using the EQ

Shape the sound by boosting or cutting frequencies.

**The 3 EQ Bands:**
- **HI (High)** - Controls treble/cymbals/hi-hats (2500Hz+)
- **MID** - Controls vocals/lead sounds (around 1200Hz)
- **LO (Low)** - Controls bass/kick drums (below 300Hz)

**Exercise: EQ Swap Transition**
| Step | Action | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Play both decks, crossfader center | Both tracks playing |
| 2 | Turn Deck A's **LO** knob to minimum | Removes Deck A's bass |
| 3 | Turn Deck B's **LO** knob to maximum | Deck B's bass dominates |
| 4 | Slowly swap the LO knobs back | Smooth bass transition! |

---

### ?? Tutorial 3: Filter Sweeps

Create dramatic sweep effects with the filter knob.

| Position | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Left (0) | Low-pass filter at 300Hz (muffled, underwater sound) |
| Center (0.5) | No filter (full sound) |
| Right (1) | High-pass filter at 9000Hz (thin, tinny, no bass) |

**Exercise: The Filter Drop**
1. Play Deck A
2. Turn filter knob slowly to the LEFT (low-pass opens up)
3. Quickly snap back to CENTER for dramatic effect!

---

### ?? Tutorial 4: Tempo Matching (Beat Matching)

Essential skill for seamless mixing.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Note the BPM display on each deck |
| 2 | If Deck B is faster, lower its Tempo fader |
| 3 | If Deck B is slower, raise its Tempo fader |
| 4 | Click **Sync** on Deck B to match Deck A automatically |

**Tempo Range:** 50% to 200% of original speed

---

### ?? Tutorial 5: Using Drum Pads

Trigger one-shot sounds for live performance.

Each deck has 4 pads:

| Pad | Deck A Sound | Deck B Sound |
|-----|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | Kick Drum | Kick 2 |
| 2 | Snare | Snare 2 |
| 3 | Hi-Hat | Hi-Hat 2 |
| 4 | Clap | Clap 2 |

**Exercise: Add Fills**
1. Play Deck A
2. During the loop, tap Pad 1 (kick) rhythmically
3. Add Pad 3 (hi-hat) for extra groove

---

### ?? Tutorial 6: Loading Different Tracks

Browse and load different patterns.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Turn the **Browse** knob in the mixer section |
| 2 | Display shows "Track 01", "Track 02", etc. |
| 3 | Click **Load A** to load pattern into Deck A |
| 4 | Click **Load B** to load pattern into Deck B |

**Available Patterns:**
- Track 01: Kick-Snare
- Track 02: Hi-Hat
- Track 03: Kick-Clap
- Track 04: Bass

---

### ?? Tutorial 7: Cue Preview

Listen to one deck in headphones while the other plays.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Click **Cue** on Deck A | Only Deck A is audible |
| 2 | Adjust Deck A's tempo/EQ without affecting output |
| 3 | Click **Cue** again to turn off | Normal crossfader mixing resumes |

5. **Listen to the beat** - tap along to feel the rhythm
